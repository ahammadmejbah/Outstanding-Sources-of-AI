### WHAT IS AI?

AI, which stands for artificial intelligence, refers, in its most basic form, to systems or computers that imitate human intellect in order to carry out tasks and may iteratively improve themselves depending on the information that they acquire. There are many different guises that AI may take. Here are a few examples:

<ol>
<li> ```python AI is used by chatbots so they can learn client issues more quickly and deliver replies that are more effective.``` </li>
<li> ```python When it comes to improving scheduling, intelligent assistants employ artificial intelligence to interpret important information from vast free-text databases.``` </li>
<li> ```python Users' watching histories may be used by recommendation engines to provide automatic suggestions for new television programmes to watch.``` </li>
</ol>

 To a far greater extent than it is concerned with any specific structure or function, artificial intelligence refers to the method as well as the potential of superpowered thinking and data processing. Although the term artificial intelligence (AI) conjures up visions of high-functioning robots that resemble people taking over the world, the purpose of AI is not to replace humans. The purpose of this initiative is to greatly improve human skills and contributions. Because of this, it is a highly significant asset for the company.



Applications that execute complicated activities that traditionally needed human input, such as conversing with clients online or playing chess, have given rise to a new category of software known as artificial intelligence (AI). The word and its subfields, which include machine learning and deep learning, are often used interchangeably with one another. However, there are several key distinctions. For instance, the field of machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can learn or enhance their functionality depending on the data that they take in. It is essential to keep in mind that while all artificial intelligence is machine learning, not all machine learning is AI.

Many businesses recognize that they must make considerable investments in data science teams if they want to realize the full potential of AI. Data science is an interdisciplinary subject that employs scientific and other approaches to extract value from data. To evaluate data gathered from a variety of sources, data scientists combine the skills they've gained in areas such as statistics and computer science with their understanding of business.
